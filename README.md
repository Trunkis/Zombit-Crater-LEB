# Zombit Crater
## At a random summit crater in Adford. The mysterious undead rises to claim its next victims.

# MAP INSPIRATION
This map was inspired by my other map I made for my Zombie Survival 1 minigame on bedrock edition. This is a new original map thats better in every way compared to the Zombie Maze map. 

# MAP FEATURES
- Support for Small, Large and Large+
- Some Secrets, Credits Room and a Music Disc Room
- Small waterfall and a Showdown area
- Optimized in file size (Trimmmed and removed the ground layer.)
- Downloads for 3 world sizes Java + Bedrock located in the releases
