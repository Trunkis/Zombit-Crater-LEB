# Zombit-Crater-LEB

Started as a Zombie Survival map for my Zombie Survival 2.0 in Minecraft for Adford but soon became a LEB map.
If you dont know what Adford is. Adford is a Playstation group that is unhinged and offensive at times.

## What was this Zombie Survival?
### My Zombie Survival Minigame was in Adford and the world name in spefcic was "this is elon musk" That world was a absolute tragedy thinking about it.
## Zombie Survival also used command blocks but had to have manunal input for the game to play.
### Zombit Crater's map scale is way bigger than Zombie Maze as seen in these screenshots:
